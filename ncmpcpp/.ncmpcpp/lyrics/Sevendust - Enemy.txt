Step up to me - Step up to me
You wanna be a big time player - it's not to be
Look at all the snide ass - actin like a wise ass
I'll fuck up your face and you'll never look back

[Chorus:]
So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
And no one at all is around
So tell me how does it feel to be the enemy?

Step up to me - Step up to me [x2]
Step up to me - Step up to me
You wanna be a big time player - it’s not to be

Look at your face - look at your name
It's funny you’re a loser with only yourself to blame
Cut your fucking hair now - scared of all the stare downs
You wanna be like me cause it's real
So you steal on your way to fame
Never gonna be - never gonna see
Your name in lights - you can always dream what ‘cha could've been
Clean up my shit - you look like a dick
Step to unemployment - step

[Chorus x2]

Step! Step up to me – step up
You’re the enemy!
[x2]

[CHORUS x2]
